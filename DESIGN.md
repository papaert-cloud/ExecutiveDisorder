# Executive Disorder - Game Design Document

## üéØ Core Concept

A satirical political decision-making game where players take on the role of a world leader navigating impossible choices. Every decision creates dramatic consequences, cascade effects, and media reactions that affect four critical resource meters.

## üéÆ Gameplay Loop

### 1. Decision Phase
- Player is presented with a crisis/situation card
- Two options are always available
- Each option has hidden consequences
- Visual representation via card UI

### 2. Consequence Phase
- Resources are modified based on choice
- Visual effects trigger (explosions, celebrations, alerts)
- Audio feedback plays
- News headlines appear
- Social media reactions display

### 3. Cascade Phase (30% chance)
- Some decisions trigger follow-up cards
- Create chain reactions of events
- Escalate or de-escalate situations
- Add unpredictability to outcomes

### 4. Game Over Check
- Any resource reaching 0 = immediate game over
- 50 decisions = successful term completion
- Ending determined by final resource state

## üìä Resource System

### Four Core Resources (0-100)
Each starts at 50 and must be carefully balanced:

1. **Popularity** üë•
   - Public approval rating
   - Affects re-election chances
   - Influenced by public-facing decisions
   - Lost through unpopular choices
   - Critical for legitimacy

2. **Stability** üèõÔ∏è
   - National order and security
   - Social cohesion indicator
   - Lost through chaotic decisions
   - Gained through law and order
   - Critical for governance

3. **Media Support** üì∫
